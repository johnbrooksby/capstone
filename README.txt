John's Plant Database is a site dedicated to my college plant id instructor who had taken hundreds (thousands?) of pictures and had them all stored on his hard drive.  He would refer to them in class and would find them by filing through his Windows Explorer window.  I wanted to created a place where plant pictures could be stored online, and where the retrieval process would be simplified.  Simply search by either scientific name, common name, or family.  

If the picture you want is not currently in the database, add it by using the form below the search fields.  All input fields are automatically edited for capitalization uniformity.  

All fields of the "Add" form are required, although the "Add New" input is not required unless the dashes or "Add a Family" is selected in the dropdown.

The "Add New" family input will only process input if the dropdown value is either "Add a Family" or the dashes at the top of the list.  Also, if the family entered in "Add New" already exists (in case the user didn't see it in the dropdown), the family listed will only be used to identify which family the plant should be added to.  It will not create a duplicate family of the same name.

The "Genus and species" input field is also unique.  A user will be able to add multiple pictures of the same plant and a new plant name will not be added to the database.  Only the new picture link will be added and will reference the existing plant.

The Home page contains pictures that are also links, which, along with the navbar links, will show the user all the plants labeled as either Evergreen, Deciduous, Flower, or Houseplant.
